This code is part of a tutorial on how to build a mobile app with Ionic 2 & Angular 2.

Read the tutorial here: [Build Your First Mobile App With Ionic 2 & Angular 2](http://gonehybrid.com/build-your-first-mobile-app-with-ionic-2-angular-2-part-5/)

For more tutorials on Ionic, check out my blog [Gone Hybrid](http://gonehybrid.com).

# How to run the app
After cloning the repo, run `npm install` followed by the `ionic serve` command.

Make sure you have all the tools installed, see [installation guide](http://gonehybrid.com/build-your-first-mobile-app-with-ionic-2-angular-2-part-2/).

# Troubleshooting
Since Ionic is still in beta, with every beta release you might have issues when running the app since it is built on an older version of the beta. I'll try to keep it up to date with every beta release, but in the mean time, check the [Ionic Forum](https://forum.ionicframework.com) and see links below for fixing issues:
